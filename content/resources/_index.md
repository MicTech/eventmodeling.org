# Community
## [Slack Group](#slack-group) {#slack-group}

The community needed a non-technical discussion on Information System design. The Slack channel was created to create an environment where this type of discussion could happen and allow a new avenue for the practice to get adopted. You can join the community through this link:

An example project starting with Event Modeling and going all the way through to implementation. It's in Polish but the model and code is in English. A translation should be out in the near future.

## [Realtime Board Template](#realtime-board-template) {#realtime-board-template}

![trello example](../event-modeling-tutorial.jpg)

In the demos of event modeling, [Miro Realtime Board](https://miro.com) is used. If you would like to get started from a small example, you can download the example event model above from [here](/event-modeling.rtb).

## [Implementation Gist](#implementation-gist) {#implementation-gist}

![trello screenshot](../trello-screenshot.png)

This script only requires [fish shell](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell) and a couple of command line utilities to show the above example work. You can find it in a gist [here](https://gist.github.com/adymitruk//7fc2adb8598ad861d4b3dae114afd4c9).
